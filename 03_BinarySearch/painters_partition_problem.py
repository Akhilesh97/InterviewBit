# Painter's Partition Problem
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/painters-partition-problem/
#
# You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available
# and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get
# this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint
# continuous sections of board.
